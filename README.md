- **Device Control:** Turn devices on and off remotely.
- **Device Status:** View real-time status of all devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **IoT Microservice:** Rust
- **Database:** SQLite

    ```

## Usage

1. **Add a Device:** Use the form on the frontend to add a new device by specifying the device name, type, and initial status.
2. **View Devices:** The main page displays all devices with their current status.
3. **Control Devices:** Use the control buttons next to each device to turn them on or off.
4. **Update Device Status:** The status of each device is updated in real-time and can be viewed on the main page.
5. **Delete a Device:** Remove devices that are no longer needed by using the delete button.

## API Endpoints

### Backend (Flask)
